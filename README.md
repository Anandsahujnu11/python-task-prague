# Python-Task-Prague
In this work, I have utilized data.traj(provided) to preparation a dataset which contain structural features describing the atomic environment of the Al atoms in  the structures stored as ASE atoms objects in 'atoms\_list' and try to build a model which can correlate the structural features with the isotropic shieldings stored in 'atoms\_data'. I have utilized python package ase, pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data manipulation and visualisation. Sklearn, keras, tensorflow for Machine learning and deep learning algorithm implementation.

In order to run these jupyter files. Either use google colab or install packages using requirements.txt in your local system to run in local machine
